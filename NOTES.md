# 📦 Publish a package to npm

## 1. Login (only the first time or when switching accounts)

```bash
npm login --auth-type=web
```

Verify that the session is active:

```bash
npm whoami
```

Expected output:

```text
bastndev
```

---

## 2. Enter the project

```bash
cd path/to/project
```

---

## 3. Check that the name is available

```bash
npm view <package-name>
```

Example:

```bash
npm view fixnow
```

If an error similar to this appears:

```text
npm ERR! code E404
```

It means the name is available to publish.

---

## 4. Review which files will be published

```bash
npm pack --dry-run
```

Verify that only the necessary files appear.

For example:

```
LICENSE
README.md
package.json
dist/
dictionaries/
```

And that these DO NOT appear:

```
src/
test/
.vscode/
.git/
node_modules/
```

---

## 5. Publish the package

```bash
npm publish
```

If the project has this script:

```json
"prepublishOnly": "npm run build"
```

npm will automatically run:

```
npm run build
↓
Pack
↓
Publish
```

---

# 🚀 Update an existing version

## Bug fix

↓
1.0.1
```

---

## Compatible new feature

npm publish
```

Example:

```
1.0.1
↓
1.1.0
```

---

## Incompatible change (Breaking Change)

npm publish
```

Example:

:

```
1.1.0

2.0.0
```

---

# ✅ Check that the publication was successful

```bash
npm view <package-name>
```

Example:

```bash
npm view fixnow
```

Or install it:

```bash
npm install <package-name>

Example:

```bash
npm install fixnow
```
